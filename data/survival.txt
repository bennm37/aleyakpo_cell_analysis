Data collection. 
For all cells that die, enter the frame number that the green dot first appears 
into the death time column. Then trace back to the "birth" time for that cell. 
If the cell is born in frame, add a 1 into the event type column. If it is off
frame or before the start of the video, add 0 into the start_time column and 
0 into the event type column. 

For all other cells, their birth time will be calculated approximately from the 
surface density (generating a curve n(t)). We will account for the cells that 
die afterwards.
